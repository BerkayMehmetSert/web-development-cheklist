## Content

1. [ ] All spelling & grammar is correct.
2. [ ] No double spaces between sentences.
3. [ ] Replace dumb quotes with smart quotes.
4. [ ] `"` ➔ `“ ”`
5. [ ] Replace all apostrophes with curly apostrophes.
6. [ ] `'` ➔ `’`
7. [ ] Use hyphens, en- and em-dashes properly.
8. [ ] Do not write all caps in the code—that’s yelling; use CSS to generate all caps.

## Design

1. [ ] Underlines are only for hyperlinks.
2. [ ] Use the minimum necessary typefaces—stick to basic web fonts if possible.
3. [ ] Avoid fake bold and italics.
4. [ ] Avoid fake small caps.
5. [ ] Choose a type scale and stick to the mathematical precision.
6. [ ] Have the font sizes scale based on the available screen space.
7. [ ] Avoid full justification—hyphenation doesn’t work reliably on the web.
8. [ ] Apply hanging punctuation and optical margin alignment where possible.
9. [ ] Try to avoid widows and orphans, though sometimes it’s practically impossible on The Web.
10. [ ] Limit the line length to something reasonable, approx. `36em`

## Usability

1. [ ] Body text you want people to read should be no smaller than `16px (1em)`.
2. [ ] Make sure the text is high enough contrast against the background.
3. [ ] Chunk content into small sections with headers, lists, pull quotes, etc.
4. [ ] Employ bold and italic to highlight important text and change computer speech phrasing.
5. [ ] Links must be distinguished from the surrounding text, ideally with an underline.
6. [ ] In most cases leave blanks lines between paragraphs instead of traditionally indented paragraphs.
